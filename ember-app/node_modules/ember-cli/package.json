  "readme": "\n## ember-cli [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli.svg)](https://david-dm.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/aj8xls90un6h77lo)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stefanpenner/ember-cli) (windows)\n\nAn ember command line utility.\n\nSupports node 0.10.5 and npm 1.4.6.\n\n## Community\n* irc: #ember-cli on freenode\n* issues: [ember-cli/issues](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues)\n* website: [ember-cli.com](http://www.ember-cli.com)\n\n\n[![ScreenShot](http://static.iamstef.net/ember-conf-2014-video.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8z3972h64)\n\n\n## Warning\n\nAlthough potentially exciting, this is still really a WIP, use at your own risk.\n\n## Project Elements\nAdditional components of this project which are used runtime in your application:\n* [ember-jj-abrams-resolver](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-jj-abrams-resolver)\n* [loader](https://github.com/stefanpenner/loader.js)\n* [ember-cli-shims](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli-shims)\n* [ember-load-initializers](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-load-initializers)\n\n## Development Hints\n### Working with master\n\n``` sh\ngit clone https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli.git\ncd ember-cli\nnpm link\n```\n\n`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo the just cloned `ember-cli/` folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the `ember-cli/` folder will immediately affect the global ember-cli package.\n\nNow you can use `ember-cli` via the command line:\n\n``` sh\nember new foo\ncd foo\nnpm link ember-cli\nember server\n```\n\n`npm link ember-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `ember-cli` just loads the local `ember-cli` from the project. `npm link ember-cli` symlinks the global `ember-cli` package to the local `ember-cli` package. Now the `ember-cli` you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `ember-cli` project you just created.\n\nIf you upgrade an app running against Ember CLI master you will need to re-link to your checkout of Ember CLI by running `npm link ember-cli` in your project again.\n\nPlease read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) and the [npm-link cheatsheet](https://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet/#Linking_any_npm_package_locally) for more information.\n\n### Working with the tests\n\nUse `npm run autotest` to run the tests after every file change (Runs only fast tests). Use `npm test` to run them once.\n\nFor a full test run which includes some very slow acceptance tests,\nplease run: `npm run test-all`. Please note, this is what travis\nruns.\n\nTo exclude a test or test suite append a `.skip` to `it()` or `describe()` respectively (e.g. `it.skip(...)`). To focus on a certain test or test suite append `.only`.\n\nPlease read the official [mocha documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) for more information.\n\n## Problems\n\nWhen running ember cli it could happen that a lack of file watches can occur. You will get an error message like:\n\n```sh\nServing on http://0.0.0.0:4200\nwatch ENOSPC\nError: watch ENOSPC\n    at errnoException (fs.js:1019:11)\n    at FSWatcher.start (fs.js:1051:11)\n  ...\n```\n\nThis problem will be corrected in future releases. The following line is a workaround to get the server up and running until this problem is fixed. See [Issue 1054](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues/1054).\n\n```sh\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p\n```\n\n## Inline Documentation\n\nUse `npm run docs` to build HTML and JSON documentation with YUIDoc and place it in `docs/build/`. Please help by improving this documentation.\n\n## Contribution\n\n[See `CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## Donating\n\nAll donations will support this project and treats for contributors.\n\n[![Support via Gittip](https://rawgithub.com/twolfson/gittip-badge/0.2.0/dist/gittip.png)](https://www.gittip.com/stefanpenner/)\n\n## License\n\nember-cli is [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
