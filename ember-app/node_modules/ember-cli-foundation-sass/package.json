  "readme": "# Ember CLI Foundation SASS Addon\n**Requires at least ember-cli v0.1.2**  \n*If you want to use it with ember-cli >=0.0.44, use v0.3.3 of the addon.*\n\nThis addon automates the steps to include SASS with [Foundation 5.4.7](https://github.com/zurb/foundation) into your ember-cli using [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass) as well as simplifying the customization of the settings and which components you want to include.\n\nIt also installs [broccoli-clean-css](https://github.com/shinnn/broccoli-clean-css), purely for convinience since it gernally seems to lead to the best minifiaction results: http://goalsmashers.github.io/css-minification-benchmark/.\n\n## Usage\n\n* `npm install ember-cli-foundation-sass --save-dev`\n* `ember g foundation-sass`\n\nRunning the blueprint installs **Foundation 5.4.7** via Bower, copies over the `_settings.scss` as well as the `foundation.scss` to your `app/styles` folder.\nIt also creates a default `app.scss` that imports the `_settings.scss` as well as the `_foundation.scss`, so you can get serve the app immediately. Lastly, it installs the already mentioned dependencies [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass) and [broccoli-clean-css](https://github.com/shinnn/broccoli-clean-css).\n\nThis setup is made so you don't have to worry about how to how to be able to customize Foundation, but just lets you do it. Furthermore [ember-cli-sass](https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass) helps that the foundation `import` statements (in the `_foundation.scss`) 'just' work.\n\n\n### Options\n\nThis addon provides an API to simplify adding the Foundation JavaScript modules and dependencies:\n\n```js\n//Brocfile.js\n//Includes modernizr, fastclick and the full foundation.js with all modules\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  'foundation-sass': {\n    'modernizr': true,\n    'fastclick': true,\n    'foundationJs': 'all'\n  }\n});\n\n//Includes the core foundation.js with the tab, topbar, orbit and dropdown module\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  'foundation-sass': {\n    'foundationJs': ['tab', 'topbar', 'orbit', 'drodpdown']\n  }\n});\n\n//Includes just the core foundation.js without any modules\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  'foundation-sass': {\n    'foundationJs': true\n  }\n});\n```",
